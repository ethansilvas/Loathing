# Loathing
Loathing is a first person survival horror game made in Unity for CSS 390: Game Design &amp; Development

You play as a traveler whose car breaks down outside of a seemingly quiet town. However, its inhabitants have taken a turn for the worse
and don't take kindly to newcomers. As you make your way through town you collect notes from an anonymous stranger, although your 
troubles only get worse when you realize that the notes are addressed to you...

This was my original idea for a game that my team chose to be our final project. Our team consisted of myself, Andrew Borrud, Becca Pope,
Christiana Tebbs, and Patrick Bradley. I was responsible for defining the story/direction for the game and I built most of the physical
game in Unity, most notably the enemy AI, character UI, and collision events.
